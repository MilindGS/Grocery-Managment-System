              Imagine needing something when you are at home and getting it
              before you have tied your shoelaces to step out. We are
              revolutionizing e-commerce by making the stuff most important to
              you, available to you in a blink of your eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want our customers to focus on the more important things for
              themselves and not need to plan for the little things that life
              needs on an everyday basis. We are here to get your chores out of
              your way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is - "instant commerce indistinguishable from magic".
              Using a backbone of technology, data sciences, and rich customer
              insights, we've built a dense and fast network of partner stores
              enabling lightning fast deliveries in minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are already one of the largest e-grocery companies in India.
              Our ambition however, is to be 100x this size in the next five
              years.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to become one of the most important e-retail companies of
              our generation, we need builders who can think on their feet, take
              extreme ownership and commit to making outcomes happen. If you are
              ambitious, smart, and don't have an ego about it, we'd love to
              hear from you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Opportunities to create $100 billion businesses in India are rare.
              We are on the way and looking for the hungry.
